					Recently I read an article about <b>Bulletproof web component loading</b> and written by <a href='https://gomakethings.com/bulletproof-web-component-loading/' target='_blanc' class='relative'>Chris Go Make Things</a> , someone who knows lot more about javascript as me.

			<article-main class='display-flex relative'>

			<article-header class='relative'>
				<h3 class='relative'>My idea.</h3>
			</article-header>
			<article-main class='display-flex relative'>

				<h3 class='relative'>How I load my js then.</h3>

			<article-main class='display-flex relative'>
				<p class='fl-one relative'>
					It's about loading js this way:
				</p>
				<p class='relative'>Step 1</p>
				<p class='fl-one relative'>
					First step is to have an <em>index.js</em> within the scripts folder and that contains the following.
				</p>
				<code class='relative'>//the imports on top.</code>
				${pre_one}
				<p class='relative'>Step 2</p>
				<p class='fl-one relative'>
					Second step, within your <em>index.html</em> this:
				</p>
				<code class='relative'>&lt;script type='module'  src='./path/to/scripts/index.js&gt; &lt;/script&gt;'</code>
			</article-main><!-- article-main 4-->				
			<article-header class='relative'>
				<h3 class='relative'><h3>Explanation</h3></h3>
			</article-header>
			<article-main class='display-flex relative'>
				<p class='fl-one relative'>
					At the first step, the code has been placed in an async (<b>I</b>mmediately <b>I</b>nvoked <b>F</b>unction <b>E</b>xpression)!
					That iife, is the final place where my js stuff ends up.
				</p>
			</article-main><!-- article-main 5-->				
			<article-header class='relative'>
				<h3 class='relative'>This way.</h3>
			</article-header>
			<article-main class='display-flex relative'>
				<p class='fl-one relative'>
					This means that the promise is 100% fulfilled before it's passed to my <em>index.html</em>.
					So what I get is a single substance that is complete and ready to use.
					Actually I rarely look at it, is no need for!

			<article-header class='relative'>
				<h3 class='relative'>Note!</h3>
			</article-header>
			<article-main class='display-flex relative'>
