> ### About
>	This is the repo of my personal github page.\
>	It is more then just a 'single page', because it contains a navigation system between a variety of pages.\
>	Still, as I recently have spend most of my time on an idea that I had. There is a lot to be updated but that is for when I have time for it.\
>	As all is functioning as intended, there is no urgency for that!

> ### My Idea: ModuleEditor
>	- A _modular_ editor that follows the natural flow of the _HTML_ elements.
>	- A _modular_ editor that is based on the _contenteditable_ attribute.
>	- A _modular_ editor that is build with _OOP_  interacts directly with the _DOM_ and is customizable.
>	- For now it has a limited set of features because I merely focussed on the stability of this editor, goal is to expand it with more features overtime.
>	- As a result of that, a _modular_ editor that is stable, fast and fun to work with.
>	- More at my **ModuleEditor's** [Readme](https://github.com/aadswebdesign/module_editor/blob/main/Readme.md)
